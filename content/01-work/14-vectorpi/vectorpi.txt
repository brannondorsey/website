Vector Pi is a collaboration with (link: http://www.asliozdoyuran.com/home.html text: Asli Ozdoyuran) in attempt to create a geometric encoding of written language through angles and lines. In our encoding, each angle represents a single character in a word, while line segments represent whole words. Many of the above images reflect different studies or versions of Vector Pi, however they all share the same basic formula to encode text of any language:

θ = (360/x) * n

Where:
θ = Angle
x = Number of letters in the alphabet (26)
n = Nth letter in the alphabet being represented (e.g. “a” = 14°, “b” = 28°, etc...).
