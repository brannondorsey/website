(link: http://brannondorsey.github.io/oculusself text:Oculus Self) is a critical artware app developed for use with the (link: http://oculusvr.com text:Oculus Rift) virtual reality head mounted display (HMD). While most virtual reality applications use advanced computer graphics and 3D engines to immerse the participant in a simulated environment, Oculus Self broadcasts the userâ€™s front-facing webcam to the stereoscopic HMD, providing them with a hyper-realistic view of themselves.
