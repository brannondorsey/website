<p class="text">Brannon Dorsey uses computational technology and reproducible electronic media to explicitly challenge digital consumption. He employs open software tools to design experiences that excite and empower individuals and collaborative communities rather than promoting the closed corporate agendas of over-powerful companies. As a young Art and Technologist, Brannon is intentional in his active participation in defining a new digital literacy that celebrates the truly profound technological era that we now live in while remaining skeptical of the ways that this technology is being used on and against us.</p> <p class="text">Brannon’s artwork ranges from networked games encouraging communication and interaction in online public spaces to large-scale real-time interactive media installations. Brannon often relies on public  participation as a driving element in his work. He creates scenarios where his viewers/users/participants find themselves making new realizations about a technology, or our collective technological state.</p> <p class="text">His work has shown in New York City, Chicago, Miami, Washington D.C., Philadelphia , and his hometown, Richmond, VA. He has shown in group exhibitions at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Miami Art Museum, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Smithsonian's American Art Museum.</p> <p class="text">
